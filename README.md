The bot also interacts with osu!'s API v2 and [the BN/NAT Management website](https://bn.mappersguild.com/)'s interOp routes to provide you with multiple stats and management systems such as:

- An OAuth2 verification system where you sign up with your osu! account in order to be granted access to the server, with usergroup-specific role assignments

- A feed system that actively keeps track of the request statuses for all BNs/NATs

- Several commands that allow you to view your playing/mapping stats from the osu! website or the BN/NAT website
